# AI-Assisted Development Guide

> AI can only be as smart as its user.

## Overview

This repository was created after my post about completing a project with 100% AI-generated code went viral, reaching 500,000 views in 24 hours & 1,000,000 views in 100 hours! ðŸ¥³ across [r/ClaudeAI](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1jj2ucr/i_completed_a_project_with_100_aigenerated_code/), [r/cursor](https://www.reddit.com/r/cursor/comments/1jj2uan/i_completed_a_project_with_100_aigenerated_code/), [r/ChatGPTCoding](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTCoding/comments/1jj0q2p/i_completed_a_project_with_100_aigenerated_code/)

This repository contains a collection of practical lessons learned from building projects with AI assistance. These insights come from real-world experience using tools like Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, and Claude to develop software projects.

While many of these lessons might seem like fundamental programming principles (and they are!), their importance is magnified when working with AI. Good practices like proper project structure, breaking down problems, and writing tests become even more critical when collaborating with AI tools. This guide explains these principles from an AI-assisted development perspective, showing how they specifically impact and improve your interaction with AI coding assistants.

## Quick Start

Browse the lessons in the `lessons/` directory, starting with [01-project-structure.md](lessons/01-project-structure.md).

## Future Steps

-   System Prompt Templates, like RulesForAI.md
